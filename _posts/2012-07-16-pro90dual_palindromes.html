<div id="BlogArticleDetail" style="font-size: 14px;"> <center> <b><font size="7">Dual Palindromes<&#47;font><&#47;b><br &#47;> <b>Mario Cruz (Colombia) &amp; Hugo Rickeboer (Argentina)<&#47;b> <&#47;center>
<p> A number that reads the same from right to left as when read from left to right is called a palindrome.  The number 12321 is a palindrome; the number 77778 is not.  Of course, palindromes have neither leading nor trailing zeroes, so 0220 is not a palindrome.  <&#47;p>
<p> The number 21 (base 10) is not palindrome in base 10, but the number 21 (base 10) is, in fact, a palindrome in base 2 (10101).  <&#47;p>
<p> Write a program that reads two numbers (expressed in base 10): <&#47;p>
<ul>
<li> N (1 <= N <= 15)          <&#47;li>
<li> S (0 < S < 10000) <&#47;li><&#47;ul> and then finds and prints (in base 10) the first N numbers strictly greater than S that are palindromic when written in two or more number bases (2 <= base <= 10).
<p> Solutions to this problem do not require manipulating integers larger than the standard 32 bits.  <&#47;p><br />
<h3>PROGRAM NAME: dualpal<&#47;h3><br />
<h3>INPUT FORMAT<&#47;h3>
<p>A single line with space separated integers N and S.  <&#47;p><br />
<h3>SAMPLE INPUT (file dualpal.in) <&#47;h3>
<pre>3 25 <&#47;pre><br />
<h3>OUTPUT FORMAT<&#47;h3>  N lines, each with a base 10 number that is palindromic when expressed in at least two of the bases 2..10.  The numbers should be listed in order from smallest to largest.<br />
<h3>SAMPLE OUTPUT (file dualpal.out)<&#47;h3>
<pre>26 27 28 <&#47;pre> <&#47;div></p>
